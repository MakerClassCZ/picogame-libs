          rgb444=False):
    """Take over the display and return (scene, buffer_a, buffer_b).

    Disables displayio auto-refresh, clears the root group and builds a Scene. On a
    busdisplay (SPI) target it also allocates two strip buffers (full width x `strip_h`,
    each `width*strip_h*2` bytes -> these two are the bulk of setup's RAM). On a
    FRAMEBUFFER target (WASM playground, Fruit Jam DVI) the scene composites straight
    into the framebuffer and the returned buffers are None.

    `strip_h` defaults to `picogame.STRIP_H` (board compile-time default: 8 on DMA boards, 24
    without). Measured (RP2040): on a DMA board smaller `strip_h` is BOTH less RAM AND faster
    (the DMA/render overlap is finer); without DMA, larger wins (fewer blocking sends). A typical
    dirty-rect repaint is insensitive to it. Pass an int to override per game. See /memory/.

    `top`/`bottom`/`left`/`right` reserve a border (px) the scene won't render into, so it
    paints only the inner play rect - draw the border yourself (HUD bars, side panels,
    a frame) so it's never recomputed per frame. E.g. a centred Tetris column: left/right.

    fast=True uses the platform fast Display (async DMA, where available).
    fast=False drives the plain busdisplay via the portable bus.send renderer -
    the same path used on ports without a DMA backend (correct everywhere, slower).

    rgb444=True (fast Display only) sends 12-bit RGB444 instead of 16-bit RGB565: ~25% less
    SPI traffic -> more FPS on transfer-bound (full-screen/scrolling) scenes, 4096 colours
    (plenty for PAL8 art). Needs a controller with COLMOD 12-bit (ST7789/ST7735; not ILI9341).
    rgb444="auto" enables it only where the board reports support (picogame.RGB444_SUPPORTED),
    so one codebase runs optimally on ST7789 and safely (RGB565) on ILI9341 - no per-board code."""

    # INVON/INVOFF - free, no pixel data); unset = leave the board init alone (other boards may not
    # send INVON at all). picogame_fx.PANEL_INVERTED reads the same key, so the InvertFlash
