# picogame_synth: real on-device sound via synthio - no WAV files, no sample RAM.
#
# CircuitPython's synthio generates audio in real time (oscillators + ADSR envelopes +
# LFOs + filters), so a whole SFX set or a MIDI tune costs almost no RAM. This wraps the
# Fruitris pattern (PWMAudioOut -> Mixer -> Synthesizer) with built-in waveforms, so games
# can finally make noise on the PicoPad/PicoSystem. (Sample-based audio lives in
# picogame_audio; this is the synthesis path.)
#
#   import picogame_synth as snd
#   s = snd.Synth()                                   # board.AUDIO, PWM out
#   beep = snd.note(72, snd.SQUARE, decay=0.08)       # an SFX (build once)
#   s.sfx(beep)                                       # fire it (retriggers cleanly)
#
# Uses synthio + audiopwmio + audiomixer when the firmware has them (both our boards do).
# SAFE ON AUDIO-LESS FIRMWARE: if those modules are missing, importing this lib still works
# and the whole API degrades to silent no-ops (Synth/Drone/note/load_midi all accept the same
# args and return inert values). ALSO SAFE ON A TIGHT HEAP: if Synth() itself fails mid-init
# (MemoryError allocating the mixer buffers, or the pin is claimed), the instance degrades to
# the same silent no-ops instead of raising - a game needs ZERO try/except guard code either
# way. Branch on the module flag `AVAILABLE` (modules present) or `synth.available` (this
# instance actually has audio out) if you want e.g. to hide a volume option.
# (The simulator provides its own synthio stub, so under the sim the real path runs.)
