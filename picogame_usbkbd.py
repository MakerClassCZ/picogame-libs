# picogame_usbkbd: read a USB HID keyboard on a USB-host board (e.g. Adafruit Fruit Jam) and expose
# it as an extra button SOURCE for picogame_input.Buttons - the keyboard twin of picogame_usbpad.
# Buttons ORs every source together, so a game gets keyboard input with ZERO code changes.
#
# Works with wired keyboards AND wireless ones that use a 2.4 GHz USB dongle (the dongle presents a
# standard HID keyboard; Bluetooth keyboards do NOT work - CircuitPython has no BT host stack).
# The keyboard is found by its BOOT-KEYBOARD interface descriptor (keyboards have no fixed VID/PID),
# preferably via adafruit_usb_host_descriptors; without that driver a plain endpoint-0x81 fallback
# covers most single-interface keyboards. Some combo dongles advertise a boot-keyboard interface
# that never delivers a report while the real keystrokes flow on a SIBLING keyboard interface
# (e.g. a Rapoo 2.4G receiver: iface 1 silent, iface 2 live). For those, point the driver at the
# right channel from settings.toml - deterministic, no auto-detection:
#   PICOGAME_USBKBD_EP = "2:0x83"                      # "interface:IN endpoint"
# (run tools/usbkbd_probe.py as code.py to find the value - it prints this exact line.)
# CircuitPython's own terminal may hold the keyboard for the REPL - the kernel driver is
# detached, so while a game runs the keyboard belongs to the game.
#
# Default layout (boot report: byte0 = modifiers, bytes 2..7 = up to 6 pressed keycodes):
#   arrows + WASD -> D-pad,  Z / Space -> A,  X -> B,  C -> X,  V -> Y,
#   Q -> L1,  E -> R1,  Enter -> START,  Esc -> SELECT
# Remap from settings.toml (no reflash), same grammar as the gamepad:
#   PICOGAME_USBKBD = "A=0x2C B=0x1B START=0x28"      # NAME=HID keycode (hex or decimal)
# (a partial list MERGES over the defaults - only the named buttons change; one keycode per
# button in the override, the defaults may alias several keycodes to one logical button.)
